# Questions {#questions .unnumbered}

1.  (10-points) For the following C program below, label the different
    parts of it:

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
          printf("Hello World!\n");

          return 0;
        }

    1.  number of command line arguments

    2.  library functions

    3.  return value

    4.  header files

2.  (5 points) Assume you got the following compiler error:

        user@si485H-base:demo$ gcc -o hello hello.c /tmp/ccC4VYbK.o:
        In function `main': hello.c:(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `world' collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

    1.  Explain this compiler error

    2.  what would the programmer need to provide in order to complete
        the compilation?

3.  (5 points) What is the difference between a system call and a
    library call? Provide a concrete example of a each (one library call
    and one system call) in your answer.

4.  (15 points) Clone the following git repo:

        git clone git@saddleback.academy.usna.edu:aviv/HW-1.git

    Where you will find `trace-me-1`:

    1.  In `trace-me-1`: What are the library functions used in this
        program as reported by `ltrace`

    2.  In `trace-me-1`: Match the system calls, via `strace` (or
        `ltrace`!), to the library calls.

5.  (20 points) In the same repo, you’ll find another program,
    `trace-me-2` that has a secret message embedded within it. Using
    `ltrace` and `strace`, extract the secret message, and explain how
    you did so. If you were unable to find the secret message, describe
    your process for partial credit.

6.  (10 points) Convert the four-byte hex values into their signed and
    unsigned values (Yes! You could use a computer for this!).

    1.  `0xffffffff`

    2.  `0x0000000b`

    3.  `0x8000000b`

    4.  `0xdeadbeef`

7.  (10 points) Complete the memory model for the following program at
    each of the labeled marks.

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>

        int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
          int a[] = {10,11,12,13};
          int * p = a; //MARK 0

          p++; //MARK 1

          p[1] = 50;
          p--; //MARK 2

          *p = 12; //MARK 3
        }

    Diagram at MARK 0

             .------.
        a--> |  10  | <--.
             |------|    |
             |  11  |    |
             |------|    |
             |  12  |    |
             |------|    |
             |  13  |    | 
             |------|    | 
          p  |   .--+----'         
             '------'

8.  (10 points) Fill in the memory diagram for array values
    byte-by-byte. Pay careful attention to the memory addresses in the
    diagram.

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>

        int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
          int a[] = {0xcafebabe,0xdeadbeef};
          char * p = (char *) a;

          p++;
          *p = 0x00; //MARK
        }

    Diagram to be completed


           a == 0xbffff6b4

           addr       value
        .------------------.
        | 0xbffff6b4 |     |
        | 0xbffff6b5 |     |
        | 0xbffff6b6 |     |
        | 0xbffff6b7 |     |
        | 0xbffff6b8 |     |
        | 0xbffff6b9 |     |
        | 0xbffff6ba |     |
        | 0xbffff6bb |     |
        '------------'-----. 

9.  (15 points) Consider the following program, label the place in
    memory where each of the variable’s values are stored. The answers
    can be `reserved`, `stack`, `heap`, `text`, or `bss`.

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>

        int mystrlen(int *s){
          int i;
          for(i=0;*s++;i++);
          return i;
        }

        int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
          char a[] = "hello";
          char * b = getenv("PATH");
          char * c = "world";
        }

    1.  `&a`

    2.  `b`

    3.  `c`

    4.  `mystrlen`

    5.  `s`
