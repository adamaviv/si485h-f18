-   You must submit your homework using this Latex template.

-   This homework is graded out of 70 points. Point values are
    associated to each question.

Questions
=========

1.  (4 points) How many bits in a 32-bit memory address are typically
    randomized in ASLR?

2.  For the following addresses, what is the non random base address?
    For example, for the stack, the base portion is 0xbf8000.

    1.  (2 points) `0x09bed40`

    2.  (2 points) `0xbd90023`

    3.  (2 points) `0xe11eefa`

3.  (10 point) Consider a guessing game where you are trying to guess
    the number I’m thinking of right now. It’s a number between 1 and m.
    Every time you guess, I change my number! How many guesses, in terms
    of n, would it take until you had a 50% chance of getting it right
    within that number of guesses?

    Write your answer in reduced form with respect to m and n.

    (*hint*: Use base 2 log is key!)

4.  (5 points) Explain how the above problem related to breaking ASLR.

5.  (5 points) Explain how a NOP sled improves your ability to brute
    force an ASLR program? Consider the situation of 32-bit address
    space.

6.  Consider a **48 bit** memory address space (6 bytes) that employs 22
    bits of randomness when basing the stack address. The first 20 bits
    are fixed for the stack, e.g., 0xbff, the next 22 bits are random,
    and the last 6 bits are fixed. (*hint: you may want to write a
    program to solve the questions below.*)

    1.  (5 points) If you had no NOP sled, how many brute force attempts
        would it take to exploit this program with 50% likelihood.

    2.  (5 points) If you had a NOP sled of 255 bytes long, how many
        brute force attempts would it take to exploit this program with
        50% likelihood?

    3.  (5 points) If you had a NOP sled of 8192 bytes long, how many
        brute force attempts would it take to exploit this program with
        50% likelihood?

    4.  (5 points) Suppose you wanted to ensure you exploited this
        program with 50% likelihood with 25 guesses, how long must your
        NOP sled be?

7.  Complete the stack diagram for leave and ret for the following
    function frame:

              .----------------.
              | shell code     |
              |----------------|
              | return address |
              |----------------|
        ebp-> |       SBP      |
              |----------------|
              |                |
              :                :
              :                :
        esp-> |                |
              '----------------'

    1.  (5 points) After the leave

    2.  (5 points) After the ret

8.  (5 points) Using the diagrams from the previous question in your
    answer, explain why `jmp esp` or `call esp` instructions will
    execute your shell code? How can this technique be used to subvert
    ASLR?

9.  (5 points) The following is a hexdump of the text segment of a
    program. What addresses (plural!) could be used as bounce points?
