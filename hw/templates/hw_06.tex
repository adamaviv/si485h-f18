\begin{itemize}
\item You must submit your homework using this Latex template.
  
\item This homework is graded out of 70 points. Point values are associated to each question.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
\label{sec:org24d21ef}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (4 points) How many bits in a 32-bit memory address are typically randomized
in ASLR?

\item For the following addresses, what is the non random base address?
For example, for the stack, the base portion is 0xbf8000.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (2 points) \texttt{0x09bed40}

\item (2 points) \texttt{0xbd90023}

\item (2 points) \texttt{0xe11eefa}
\end{enumerate}

\item (10 point) Consider a guessing game where you are trying to guess the number
I'm thinking of right now. It's a number between 1 and m. Every
time you guess, I change my number! How many guesses, in terms of
n, would it take until you had a 50\% chance of getting it right
within that number of guesses? 

Write your answer in reduced form with respect to m and n. 

(\emph{hint}: Use base 2 log is key!)

\item (5 points) Explain how the above problem related to breaking ASLR.

\item (5 points) Explain how a NOP sled improves your ability to brute force an
ASLR program? Consider the situation of 32-bit address space.

\item Consider a \textbf{48 bit} memory address space (6 bytes) that employs
22 bits of randomness when basing the stack address. The first 20
bits are fixed for the stack, e.g., 0xbff, the next 22 bits are
random, and the last 6 bits are fixed. (\emph{hint: you may want to
write a program to solve the questions below.})

\begin{enumerate}
\item (5 points) If you had no NOP sled, how many brute force attempts would it
take to exploit this program with 50\% likelihood.

\item (5 points) If you had a NOP sled of 255 bytes long, how many brute force
attempts would it take to exploit this program with 50\%
likelihood?

\item (5 points) If you had a NOP sled of 8192 bytes long, how many brute force
attempts would it take to exploit this program with 50\%
likelihood?

\item (5 points) Suppose you wanted to ensure you exploited this program with
50\% likelihood with 25 guesses, how long must your NOP sled
be?
\end{enumerate}

\item Complete the stack diagram for leave and ret for the following
function frame:

\begin{verbatim}
      .----------------.
      | shell code     |
      |----------------|
      | return address |
      |----------------|
ebp-> |       SBP      |
      |----------------|
      |                |
      :                :
      :                :
esp-> |                |
      '----------------'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (5 points) After the leave

\item (5 points) After the ret
\end{enumerate}

\item (5 points) Using the diagrams from the previous question in your answer,
explain why \texttt{jmp esp} or \texttt{call esp} instructions will execute
your shell code? How can this technique be used to subvert ASLR?

\item (5 points) The following is a hexdump of the text segment of a
program. What addresses (plural!) could be used as bounce
points?
