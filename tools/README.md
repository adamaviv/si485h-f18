# Tools, Tips, and Tricks

In this directory, you'll find a number of useful programs that will make your
life easier. However, just because they're provided, doesn't mean you don't have
to understand them, so do take a look at their source code. There are things to
learn.

* [Makefile](Makefile) : A handy, universal makefile that can compile most C and asm
  programs with the right arguments for 32 bit with all the fancy stuff turned
  of. Just put it in your source directory and fire away. It doesn't not handle
  dependencies, though, so sources should be self contained.
