# Labs

You can find lab assignments in the gitlab system by searching for available
projects. See the [gitlab guide](../resources/gitlab.md) for using gitlab and
[submission guide](../resources/submission.md) for information about how to
complete and submit a lab.

(*Note if you are viewing this page on github, off the yard, you need to be on the yard to access the specific labs*)
